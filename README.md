# Customer Analytics and Segmentation

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on leveraging advanced analytics to drive business growth through improved customer understanding and engagement. This project encompasses a range of techniques to evaluate Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) and perform customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. The insights generated from this analysis are crucial for crafting targeted marketing strategies and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

Our project uses data from an online retail store to:
1. Calculate key metrics like Average Order Value and Purchase Frequency.
2. Predict Customer Lifetime Value using advanced statistical models.
3. Segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors.
4. Implement and automate these analyses for ongoing usage.

## Business Problem

E-commerce businesses face the challenge of not just attracting but also retaining customers. By accurately predicting the Customer Lifetime Value and understanding customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts more effectively, ensuring a personalized customer experience and optimizing resource allocation.

## Data Source

We utilize the "Online Retail II" dataset, which contains transaction records from a UK-based online retail store between December 2009 and December 2011. You can access the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II).

### Data Variables

- **InvoiceNo**: Unique number per transaction; 'C' indicates a cancellation.
- **StockCode**: Unique product code.
- **Description**: Name of the product.
- **Quantity**: Number of items sold.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of the invoice.
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit in sterling.
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for the customer.
- **Country**: Customer's country.

## Analytical Methods

### CLTV Prediction

- **Data Preparation**: Structuring data for analysis.
- **BG-NBD Model**: Predicting the expected number of transactions.
- **Gamma-Gamma Model**: Estimating the expected average profit.
- **CLTV Calculation**: Combining the above models to calculate the CLTV.
- **Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on their predicted CLTV.

### RFM Segmentation

- **Data Understanding and Preparation**: Cleaning and structuring data.
- **Calculating RFM Metrics**: Determining how recently and frequently customers buy, and how much they spend.
- **Scoring and Segmenting**: Assigning scores to each metric and categorizing customers based on these scores.
